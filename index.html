                &copy;The University of Memphis is one of my favorite school in Memphis.<br>
                I remember two years ago visiting that great structure for the first time.<br>
                 I really appreciate the way how that place was built, and it was a great experience.<br>
                It is located on Central Ave (Midtown Memphis).<br>
                I was really excited to see all the entertainment places of that place.<br>
                In addition, I&nbsp;really liexitked the design of the library which looks wide an beautiful.

               <P>
                Artist's rendering of the $33 million land bridge project, <br>
                which will connect the two main parts of the campus currently dissected by railroad tracks.<br>
                I appreciate the project of that bridge. So, i will not be late anymore.
